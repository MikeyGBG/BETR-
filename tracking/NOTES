NOTES:
  The code in this repository uses a great amount of code from the matab tracking example.
  http://au.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/motion-based-multiple-object-tracking.html
  
  
  The code identifies the moving objects accross the frames, however, it depends on a video 
  format and hence, the velocities can not be extracted.
  
  The code is hence not to be used in the final submission.
