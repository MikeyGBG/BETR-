Things we need:

Localisation - determining camera intrinsics and extrinsics (calibrations),

Image aquisition- efficiently aquiring and processing the rgbd video feed for processing

Segmentation -Hough transforms, morphologoical techniques, perspective transformations

Classification- Working out domino values

Speed estimation
